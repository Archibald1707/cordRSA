# RSA-Coded Chat Application

This is a simple client-server chat application that uses RSA encryption for secure communication between clients and the server. The project is written in Python and includes color-coded logging for better readability of messages and errors. A graphical user interface (GUI) client is also available using Tkinter.

## Features
- **RSA Encryption**: Secure message transmission between clients and server using RSA public and private key pairs.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Multi-threading allows clients to send and receive messages simultaneously.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A Tkinter-based GUI client that allows users to send and receive encrypted messages through a simple interface.
- **Cryptographically Secure Random Numbers**: The `secrets` module is used to generate secure random numbers for RSA key generation.
- **Color-Coded Logging**: Terminal outputs are color-coded using the `colorama` library to easily distinguish between message types and errors.
- **Gitignore Configuration**: Excludes unnecessary files such as `__pycache__` and other auto-generated Python files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Archibald1707/cordRSA
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) If `colorama` is not listed in `requirements.txt`, install it manually:
    ```bash
    pip install colorama
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

2. **Start the client** (in a separate terminal or on a different machine):
    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```
